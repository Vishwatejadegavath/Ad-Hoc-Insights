## 🎯 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world challenge faced by data analysts. **AtliQ Hardwares**, a fictional leader in computer hardware, sought to improve its data-driven decision-making capabilities. The management team initiated a SQL challenge to hire junior data analysts capable of providing clear, actionable insights on short notice.

My role was to act as an applicant, tackling 10 ad-hoc business questions. The core objective was to query the company's database using SQL and then translate the findings into a compelling presentation for top-level management.

> **The goal:** Move beyond simply providing data, and instead, deliver a strategic narrative that could guide business decisions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Database:** MySQL (for querying and data extraction)
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI (for creating interactive dashboards)
- **Presentation:** Microsoft PowerPoint (for final reporting)
